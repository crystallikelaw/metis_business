### Exercise #1: Admissions Team Help

You are a data scientist for a data science bootcamp. The admissions team reaches out to you to help decrease the number of applicants who drop out of the application process. How would you approach this problem?

### Exercise #2: Shipping Company Safety

You are a data scientist for a shipping company. As a part of a new safety initiative, the executive team would like your help to decrease the number of employee accidents in warehouses. How would you approach this problem?
