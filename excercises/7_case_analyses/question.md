Create a preliminary proposal in whatever form you'd like (e.g. a pdf of a document, a slide deck). 

You work at a consulting firm that specializes in the food industry. You scored a last-minute meeting with Nabisco, who is interested in engaging your firm to help increase cereal sales through improved brand recognition. You have access to a dataset about the nutritional content and consumer rating of 77 cereals from Nabisco and their competitors. You can read more about the dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/80-cereals). (Note: the spreadsheet will not render in this platform; click the "Download" button on the top right.)

Put together a preliminary proposal for Nabisco using one or more of the tools covered in this course, e.g. spreadsheets, Tableau, slide presentations.

Some questions to consider:

* What insights can you take away from the dataset?
* How would you validate these claims?
* What questions do you have for the Nabisco team?
* What additional data (both internally from Nabisco and externally from other sources) would you want access to?
