For this exercise, you will be researching and reporting on a real-life business use case of data science.

1. Pick a domain that you are familiar with or would like to become more familiar with, such as finance, healthcare, government, education, manufacturing, etc.
2. Search for one or more articles describing a specific use case of data science methods in this domain. For example, the articles below describe how an Australian analytics firm partnered with an India-based nonprofit to identify villages most at risk of human trafficking.

    * [Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/big-data-tackles-human-trafficking-indian-ngo-aussie-analytics-firm-quantium-partner-save-lives/)

3. Answer the following questions, referencing the Project Identification lesson as needed:
    * Of the problem types introduced in the lecture, with which one does this use case most closely align?
    * How did the company/organization use data science to achieve a desired impact?
    * What was their impact hypothesis?
    * What was their data science solution path? Can you think of any other solution paths they may have or could have considered?
    * What data did they use?
    * What lingering questions do you have about this case study?
