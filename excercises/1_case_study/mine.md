### Questions

1. Of the problem types introduced in the lecture, with which one does this use case most closely align?
   - Prediction
2. How did the company/organization use data science to achieve a desired impact?
   - How to optimally run a particular plant
   - How to estimate future renewable production, using things like weather data, etc.
   - How to optimally route electricity to minimise congestion and transportation costs
3. What was their impact hypothesis?
   - Optimising the above would reduce cost; wastage
4. What was their data science solution path? Can you think of any other solution paths they may have or could have considered?
   - The article only mentions optimising individual power plants
   - Optimising the grid, and matching geographical supply and demand better could also increase efficiency
   - Distributed generation, like rooftop solar, could also help
5. What data did they use?
   - Presumably generation and plant-level data
6. What lingering questions do you have about this case study?
   - They don't really talk about specifics, so I have little but questions.
