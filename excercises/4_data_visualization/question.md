Complete a makeover of a chart using data visualization best practices. You should spend roughly an hour working on this exercise.
## Dataset

Go to the following [article](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economy-added-jobs-faster-than-all-g7-economies-combined-2017-1?r=UK) about employment growth in the G7 countries.


Note the pie chart graphs at the bottom of the article. Your job is to create one or more charts that narrate a story based on the data from this article. Use the best practices learned in class.

The dataset is in the table below:

| Country | Employment Share | Net Employment Growth Share | 
|--|:---:|:--------:|
| United States  | 	42     |   	55.9 | 
| Canada  | 	5.1 | 	5.2 | 
| France  | 	7.6 | 	3.8 | 
| Germany  | 	11.5 | 	15.5 | 
| Italy  | 	6.5 	| 0.9 |
| Japan  | 	18.4 | 	6.9 |
| United Kingdom | 	8.8  |	11.9 |


### Charts

You can use any type of chart: pie, line, histogram, bar, etc.

### Tools

You can use any tool: Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau, Python, etc.

Once you are done, take a screenshot of your chart and share it with your peers on Slack. If you have more time, start a completely different chart with the same data.

### Tips

* Spend about 15 minutes reading the article and exploring the data. Look for anything interesting or a question about the data you wish to answer.
* Play around with the data by creating different chart types; this can also help inspire ideas.
* Different chart types highlight different insights about the data. Decide what key points you would like your visualization to convey.
* If you feel constrained by time, keep the charts simple. The complexity of the charts will increase with practice and experience.
* Finally, you should focus on the formatting. Spend the remainder of your time making sure the visual looks good.
